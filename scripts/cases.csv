Students follow the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the process it went through to craft a policy to reduce public consumption of trans fats in restaurants. In 2005, the department&rsquo;s Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention and Control elected after considerable internal negotiations to launch a public awareness campaign aimed equally at consumers, restaurants and their suppliers. But after a year, the awareness campaign had not budged the rate of trans fat use in restaurants. In 2006, the department decided to resort to regulation, despite the risks of triggering protests of a &ldquo;nanny state,&rdquo; not to mention pushback from industry.<br />_x000d_

	This case introduces journalism students to the dilemma of raising awareness about social issues without harming the individuals involved--and remaining as objective as possible. In May 2005, Mildred Ngesa, a columnist and features writer for Nairobi&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Daily Nation</em>&nbsp;newspaper, is deeply troubled to learn about an 11-year-old sexual abuse victim also likely infected with HIV. Ngesa wants to draw public attention to the national problem of child rape, but also to protect &ldquo;Laura&rdquo; (a pseudonym) from any further trauma. Ngesa also is given a disturbing photograph of the girl&rsquo;s genitals, badly infected with a sexually transmitted disease.</p>_x000d_

	This case study examines the challenges and tradeoffs for a small sub-Saharan African country with limited resources as it tries to combat one of the highest rates of HIV-AIDS infection in the world. Swaziland in 1999 declared HIV-AIDS a national disaster. However, under the direction of Dr. Velphi Okello as national antiretroviral therapy (ART) coordinator at the Ministry of Health, the country gradually began to take charge of its own treatment and prevention programs. Okello learned to leverage both internal and international resources to maintain supplies of the essential but expensive ART drugs needed to treat and prevent the further spread of HIV.</p>_x000d_

	This case takes a behind-the-scenes look at how a national security reporter works. In February 2013, reporter Barton Gellman first learns about a source who claims to have National Security Agency (NSA) documents. Over the next four months, he and his collaborator, Laura Poitras, try to verify whether the source is credible and the materials bona fide. The documents, if true, reveal details about an intrusive NSA program that swept up private communications on a scale unsuspected by most US citizens or Congress. Nine Internet companies gave the NSA access to the information. In late May, Gellman takes the story to the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>, which agrees to work with him to publish it.<br />_x000d_
