But it has not yet had a rigorous evaluation&mdash;one that would argue for aggressive expansion. In 2005, Linda Fried, director of the Center on Aging and Health at Johns Hopkins University, wants to submit a proposal to the National Institutes of Health to fund randomized controlled trial of the Baltimore chapter of Experience Corps.
