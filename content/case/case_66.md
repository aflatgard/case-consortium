  \ Prophet Mohammed, the influential French paper <em>Le Monde</em> found itself\
  \ balancing two priorities: to respect religious beliefs and to support freedom\
  \ of expression. Students can use this case to debate the role of religion in a\
  \ secular society and the contribution the media can make to stoking or calming\
